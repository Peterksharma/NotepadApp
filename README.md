## The Task

```
-AS A small business owner

-SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
```


### <span style="color:yellow;">**Logic Followed**</span> 


#### Display the current day at the top of the calendar:
1. Use Day.js to get the current day and format it as desired.
2. Update the content of the element with the id="currentDay" using JavaScript/jQuery.

#### Create timeblocks for standard business hours:
1. Instead of hardcoding the timeblocks in the HTML, use JavaScript/jQuery to dynamically generate the timeblocks.
2. Loop through the standard business hours (e.g., 9AM to 5PM) and create a div for each hour with the appropriate classes and structure as given in the example HTML.

#### Color code timeblocks based on whether they are in the past, present, or future:
1. During the timeblock generation loop, compare the current hour with the hour of the timeblock.
2. Add the appropriate class ("past", "present", "future") to the timeblock div based on the comparison.

#### Allow users to enter an event in a timeblock:
1. This functionality is already provided in the example HTML with the use of the textarea element.

#### Save the event text to local storage when the save button is clicked:
1. Add a click event listener to the save buttons.
In the event handler, get the text from the corresponding textarea and save it to the local storage using a unique key (e.g., the hour of the timeblock).

#### Load the saved events from local storage when the page is refreshed:
1. During the timeblock generation loop, check if there is any saved event data in the local storage for each hour.
2. If there is saved event data, populate the corresponding textarea with the saved text.
